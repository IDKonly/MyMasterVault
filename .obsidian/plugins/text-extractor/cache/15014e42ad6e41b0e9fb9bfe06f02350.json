Indeed, in addition to histone methylation, Cps35 is involved in 3â€™ end forma- tion of specific mMRNAs and snoRNAs, and transcriptiona termination (Nedea et al., 2003; Dichtl et al., 2004; Cheng et al., 2004). As a matter of fact, Cps35 is the only subuni of COMPASS that is essential for viability in yeast (Miller et al., 2001; Roguev et al., 2001). However, the tempera- ture sensitive alleles of Cps35 demonstrated a loss of H3K4 methylation indicating its importance in H3K4 trime- thylation (Cheng et al., 2004).","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":"eng"}
