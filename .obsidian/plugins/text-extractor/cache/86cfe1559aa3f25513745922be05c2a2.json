[For Authors] The Genome Reports contents are as follow: - The Abstract should contain 100 words or less. - The total length of the main text (excluding Acknowledgments and references) should not exceed 3,000 words. - Up to.a maximum of four display items (1 Tables/ 3 Figures). - The number of references is limited to 10. Providing sequence(s) alone is unlikely to be accepted. New sequence data should be deposited in public databases, such as GenBank, EMBL, DDBJ, or KOBIC. The accession numbers should be included in a separate paragraph at the end of the Materials and Methods section (e.g., “The Gen- Bank/EMBL/DDB] accession number for the sequence reported in this paper is AAO0000\"). - For manuscripts reporting genomic or transcriptomic data (e.g., microarray, next-generation sequencing, or other high-throughput), authors should deposit the data in the appropriate public database (e.g., Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and BioProject in NCBI, CIBEX) and provide an approved accession number in a separate paragraph at the end of the Materials and Methods section. Genome Reports will be read by the member of editorial board and a minimurm of two reviewers. The editor’s decision s usually rendered within 1 weeks for reports that conform to standards.","libVersion":"0.2.3","langs":"eng"}
