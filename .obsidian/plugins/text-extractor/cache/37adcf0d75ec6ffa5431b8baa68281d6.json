Allow to grow overnight with rotating at 30°C. 3. Harvest cells by centrifugation at 3000rpm for 5 min. 4. Pour off media and wash with 1mL H20 (resuspend the pellet with water and harvest by centrifugation at 3000rpm for Smin). 5. Resuspend in 200uL NIB (nuclear isolating buffer) and transfer to 1.5mL tube. 6. Add 200uL glass beads (0.5mm). 7. Vortex in cold room for 20~30 min. 8. Poke hole in bottom of tube with a needle and allow liquid to flow into original 15mL tube by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5min. 9. Pipette off supernatant. 10. Add 2 pellet-volume of water (around 100uL) and transfer to 1.5mL tube. 11. Add same volume of 4X loading buffer and boil for Smin.
