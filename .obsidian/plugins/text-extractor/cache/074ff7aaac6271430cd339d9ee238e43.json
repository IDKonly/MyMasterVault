Each OTU bacterial load as in qPCR. Each OTU provides a percentage of reads that totals 100% {% contributes a proportion of reads that add up to 100% in each sample. The in each sample. The problem with looking for correlations here s that if one OTU problem with searching for correlations here is that if there is an increase in increases, all o the other OTUs must drop, giving the appearance of a negative one OTU, all of the other OTUs must decrease, and this ends up looking like a correlation between the increasing OTU and everything else when this is not the negative correlation between the increased OTU and everything else when case. this may not be the case. - R e i awtoomme s @ 8 0 @ Crangea iorsz — Srucurs Cranges @ Longest Uncranges Word ) .
