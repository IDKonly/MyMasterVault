Crude extracts were cleared by three consecutive 30-min centrifu- gation steps at maximum speed in a table-top centrifuge at 4°C. Concentration of total protein was determined by Bradford analy- sis and 50 pg total protein were analyzed from each sample by SDS-PAGE on 15% gels. Antibodies for detection of di- and tri- methylated H3K4 were obtained from Abcam. Protein extracts for gel-filtration analysis were prepared as described for histone ex- tracts described above, but in homogenization buffer B (150 mM KCl, 20 mM Tris-HCI at pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 0.01% NP-40, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF). Three hundred fifty micrograms total protein were applied to a SMART Superdex 200 column, equili- brated in homogenization buffer B. Eighty-milliliter fractions were collected and 20 pL were used for SDS-PAGE on 12% gels. Mo- lecular weight standards (Blue dextran: 2000 kD; thyroglobin: 669 kD; ferritin: 440 KD; catalase: 232 kD; ovalbumin 43 kD) were resolved under identical conditions. Production of GST-fusion proteins, in vitro translation, and GST pull-down assays were per- formed as described (Dichtl et al. 2002b). Preparation of extracts and in vitro 3’ end processing was done as described (Ohnacker et al. 2000).","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":"eng"}
