Equilibrate the gel in Towbin transfer buffer (26 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine pH 8.3, 20% MeOH) for 10 min. 2. Soak two pieces of extra-thick (2.4 mm) fitter paper in transfer buffer. Six pieces of thick (0.8 mm) fitter paper can be used if extra-thick paper is not available. 3. While the gel is equiibrating, prepare a transfer membrane. Wet a nitrocellulose membrane briefly in transfer buffer or PVDF membrane in methanol or ethanol for 30 sec, then wash in water for 1-2 min, and equilibrate in transfer buffer for at least 10 min with agitation. 4. Assemble the transfer sandwich on the cassette base (anode) by placing one piece of et extra-thick or three pieces of wet thick filter paper on the bottom, then the membrane, the gel, and finally, the remainder of the wet fiter paper on top. Use the blot roller to remove air from between the assembled layers (Figure 19). 5. Once the stacks are positioned in the cassette base, place the cassette lid on the base. The lid is reversible, but ensure that the electrical contacts fit closely into the slots in the base. Press the lid down firmly and turn the dial clockwise to engage the lid pins into the locking slots. 6. Load a second cassette if desired. Refer to Table 1 for the appropriate combinations of gels that can be used in a single run. 7. Slide the cassette (with the dial facing up) into the bay until it makes contact with the magnetic interlock and you hear a click. Cassettes can be inserted into the bays in any order, with or without power to the system. 8. Select the LIST button from the Home menu and the STANDARD SD transfer protocol from the Bio-Rad preprogrammed protocols, or the user-defined protocol of choice. 9. Toinitiate the run, press the navigation button that corresponds to A:RUN for the cassette in the upper bay or B:RUN for the cassette in the lower bay.
