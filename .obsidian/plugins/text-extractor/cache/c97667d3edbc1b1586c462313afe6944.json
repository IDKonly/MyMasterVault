Introduction Two Gel Filtration Calibration Kits are available for protein molecular weight determination by gel filtration. The Low Molecular Weight Kit contains 5 proteins with molecular weights in the range 6500 to 75 000 and Blue Dextran 2000. The High Molecular Weight Kit contains 5 proteins with molecular weights in the range 44 000 to 669 000 and Blue Dextran 2000. The use of gel filtration chromatography for the determination of the molecular weight and size of proteins is well documented. The technique is based on the well-established ability of gel filtration media, such as Superdex™, Superose™, Sephacryl™, Sephadex™ and Sepharose™ to separate molecules according to size. Prepacked columns are available (Table 3) and can be run on chromatography systems such as, ÄKTA™ design. Molecular weight determination by gel filtration are carried out by comparing an elution volume parameter, such as Kav of the protein of interest, with the values obtained for several known calibration standards. In practice it is found that for homologous series of compounds a sigmoid relationship exists between their various elution volume parameters and the logarithm of their molecular weights. The molecular weight of an unknown protein can be determined from the calibration curve (plot of Kav versus the logarithm of molecuar weight) once its Kav value is calculated from its measured elution volume. For accurate determination of molecular weight, the calibration standards must have the same relationship between molecular weight and molecular size as the substance of interest. GE Healthcare Calibration Kits provide highly purified, well- characterized, globular protein standards for protein molecular weight determination. 78 Table 3.

Procedure 1) Selection of gel filtration column Select a column with a fractionation range so that the expected molecular weight of your sample falls approximately in the middle of the range for that column. Superdex 200 can be used for a preliminary, quick approximation of the sample’s molecular weight. A bed length of 30 to 60 cm is sufficient for most determinations. 2) Equilibration of the column If\tthe\tcolumn\thas\tbeen\tstored\tin\t20%\tethanol,\twash\tthe\tcolumn\tfirst\t with 2 column volumes of distilled water. Equilibrate the column with 2 column volumes of buffer. A buffer with a pH of 6–8 and an ionic strength ≥ 0.15 M is suggested. A typical buffer is 50 mM phosphate in 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.2. 3) Choice of calibration kit proteins Include Calibration Kit proteins of a higher molecular weight and of a lower molecular weight than that of the sample. The proteins listed in Table 4 may be mixed to give resolved peaks. Table 4. Suitable protein mixtures for resolved peaks.

Dissolve the content of the vial in a buffer with a pH of 6–8 and an ionic strength of ≥ 0.15 M (e.g 50 mM phosphate, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.2). Ferritin and aldolase are supplied mixed with sucrose or mannitol to maintain stability and aid their solubility. For these two proteins, it is particularly important to dissolve the full content of the vial to get an homogeneous solution. It is recommended that carbonic anhydrase is dissolved in distilled water to avoid the formation of aggregates during freezing and thawing. 5) Protein mix preparation Dilute the proper combination of calibration kit proteins in the buffer. To obtain peaks with similar heights at 280 nm, use the concentrations in Table 5. The concentrations have been calculated with\tan\tassumed\tapplied\tvolume\tof\t0.5%\tof\tthe\tgeometrical\tcolumn\t volume (Vc). See appendix for a thorough explanation how to prepare a typical protein mix sample. Note: If precipitation of the proteins occurs upon mixing we recommend brief centrifugation to clarify the protein mixture before applying it to the column. 12 Table 5.

To get good resolution, the\tsample\tsize\tshould\tnot\texceed\t2%\tof\tthe\tgeometric\tcolumn\t volume, Vc. (Vc= r2 × π × l where r is radius and l is column length). 7) Determination of elution volume (Ve) From the UV curve, determine the elution volumes (Ve) for the Calibration Kit proteins by measuring the volume of the eluent from the point of injection to the center of the elution peak, see figure 1. 8) Determination of void volume (Vo) The elution volume for Blue Dextran 2000 is equal to the column void volume (Vo). Prepare a fresh solution of Blue Dextran 2000 (1.0 mg/ml) in the buffer. The rate of solubilization of the Blue Dextran 2000 may be increased by heating the buffer to 50°C before adding the Blue Dextran 2000. 13 Apply\ta\tsample\tto\tthe\tcolumn\t(sample\tsize,\t0.5%\tof\tthe\tgeometric\t column volume) to determine the void volume (Vo). The elution of Blue Dextran can be conveniently monitored at wavelengths of 254, 280 or 620 nm. It is strongly recommended that the Blue Dextran 2000 is run alone, not mixed with the Calibration Kit or sample proteins, as the fraction of Blue Dextran is broad and may overlap the protein peaks. Always calculate the void volume from the first eluted peak from Blue Dextran. Figure 1. Elution profiles of Calibration Kit proteins on HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 pg column. Elution volumes (Ve) are found at maximum peak height of each respective protein, see for example, carbonic anhydrase. 0 100 200 300 400 mAU 0 20 40 60 100 120 ml80ferritin aldolase conalbumin ovalbumin carbonic anhydrase ribonuclease Aaprotinin Ve Column: HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 pg Geometric column volume (VC): 120 ml Sample volume: 500 µl Buffer: 50 mM phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.2 Flow rate: 1 ml/min System: ÄKTAexplorer™ 10 Detection: 280 nm 14 9) Preparation of calibration curve Calculate the Kav values for the Calibration Kit proteins using the equation: where Vo = column void volume, Ve = elution volume, and Vc = geometric column volume. Prepare a calibration curve of Kav versus log molecular weight either on semilogarithmic paper or with a calculation program. It should be possible to fit a curve to the data points, see Figures 2 to 10. 10) Molecular weight determination Apply\tthe\tunknown\tsample\t(volume\t0.1\tto\t2%\tof\tVc) and determine the elution volume (Ve) of the compound of interest. Adjust the concentration of the sample taking into consideration that a sample of\t0.5%\tof\tVc will be diluted 5 to 15-fold during the run. Calculate the corresponding Kav for the component of interest and determine its molecular weight from the calibration curve prepared using the Calibration Kit proteins. Note that the molecular weight determinations using the molecular weights of glycoproteins, lipoproteins, non-globular proteins, or other polymers may not correlate well to the calibration curves established for globular proteins by the Calibration Kit proteins. For such compounds, useful information can be obtained by relating their elution volume data to a molecular size parameter, such as Stoke´s radius (RSt), rather than to molecular weight values. Plots of √-log (Kav) vs. RSt have been used successfully to determine the Stoke´s radius of proteins and our Calibration Kit proteins may be used for these plots too. Kav = Ve - Vo Vc - Vo 15 6.

Important notes 7.1. The use of the calibration kits with denaturing solvents The molecular weight ranges given in Table 3 are for globular proteins in their native conformations. The use of denaturing agents, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), chaotropic salts and guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) and hydrogen bond disrupting agents, such as urea, may alter the molecular conformation of proteins often greatly increasing their hydrodynamic volumes. Since separations by gel filtration are based on molecular size, the molecular weight ranges change when the proteins assume extended conformations. Superdex 200 has the most useful molecular weight range and flow properties in solvents where proteins are completely denatured (exclusion limit is approximately 120 000 for completely denatured proteins). The Low Molecular Calibration Kit is suitable for the calibration of columns in denaturing solvents. Each protein in the kit comprises of a single polypeptide chain therefore, their molecular weights do not change when they are exposed to denaturants (although their Stoke´s Radii do change). 7.2. Dimer and oligomer formation in calibration kit proteins The ribonuclease A, conalbumin, aldolase, ferritin and thyroglobulin standards may contain small amounts of apparent dimers or oligomers that elute in the void volume or slightly before the true peak. Dimers can be used to produce more calibration points, however, pure dimer formation has to be determined before calculations. 21 7.3. Electrophoresis calibration kits Gel Filtration Calibration Kits (HMW and LMW) contain protein standards for use in gel filtration chromatography only. Kits containing protein standards for molecular weight determination by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis are also available from GE Healthcare. Please visit, www.gelifesciences.com 22 8.
