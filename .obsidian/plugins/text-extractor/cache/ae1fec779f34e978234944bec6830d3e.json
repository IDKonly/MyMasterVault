Interactions between CDC73, WDR61, and CTR9 with PNUTS have previously been identified (Hein et al., 2015; Landsverk et al., 2019), and CDC73 and WDR61 were putative hitsin our SILAC IP (Table S1), suggest- ing the whole or parts of the PAF complex may functionally interact with WDR82/PNUTS-PP1. Here, we show that CDC73 is required for suppression of replication following depletion of PNUTS or WDR82. CDC73 binding to the phospho-CTD is stimulated by di- phosphorylation on S5/S2 or S5/S7 (Qiu et al., 2012). Moreover, CDC73 binds more to RNAPI| after depletion of PNUTS (Landsverk etal., 2019). CDC73 may thus partially shield RNAPII from other p- RNAPII S5 phosphatases and/or from the proteasome machinery itself. Interestingly, in yeast, CDC73 and the PAF1 complex were required for Mec1 dependent removal of RNAPII during replication stress (Poli et al., 2016), suggesting interspecies differences or multiple pathways for RNAPII degradation.","libVersion":"0.2.4","langs":"eng"}
