Repressive H3K27me3 is transmitted to embryos on sperm chromosomes and without PRC2 is transmitted through cell divisions. (A) Diagram of oocyte and sperm union to generate M—P+ embryos with H3K27me3 inherited from the sperm (P+) but not the oocyte (M-) and lacking maternal and paternal HMT. (B) Images of the two pronuclei in a one-cell embryo, and a diploid nucleus in a two-cell embryo. Merge panels show DNA (red) and H3K27me3 (green). The polar bodies [shown in (A)] identify the pronuclei as oocyte-derived (00) or sperm-derived (sp). (C) Perdurance of paternally inherited H3K27me3 on a subset of chromosomes until the ~24-cell stage. Also see fig. S5, and fig. S6 for wild type.","libVersion":"0.2.2","langs":"eng"}
