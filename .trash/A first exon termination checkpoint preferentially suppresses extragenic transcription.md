Abstract
---
Interactions between the splicing machinery and RNA polymerase II increase protein-coding gene transcription. Similarly, exons and splicing signals of enhancer-generated long noncoding RNAs (elncRNAs) augment enhancer activity. However, elncRNAs are inefficiently spliced, suggesting that, compared with protein-coding genes, they contain qualitatively different exons with a limited ability to drive splicing. We show here that the inefficiently spliced first exons of elncRNAs as well as promoter-antisense long noncoding RNAs (pa-lncRNAs) in human and mouse cells trigger a transcription termination checkpoint that requires WDR82, an RNA polymerase II-binding protein, and its RNA-binding partner of previously unknown function, ZC3H4. We propose that the first exons of elncRNAs and pa-lncRNAs are an intrinsic component of a regulatory mechanism that, on the one hand, maximizes the activity of these cis-regulatory elements by recruiting the splicing machinery and, on the other, contains elements that suppress pervasive extragenic transcription.
