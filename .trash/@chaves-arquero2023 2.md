> his complex, named after the proteins Nrd1 [13,20], Nab3 [21] and Sen1 [22], is early recruited to the transcription apparatus through the interaction between Nrd1 and phosphorylated Ser5 of the C-terminal repeats of RNA Pol II (hereafter CTD) [23,24]. The CTD is made up of 26 repeats of an heptapeptide (52 in humans) with the Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7 consensus sequence [25–29]. Then specifictermination signals are recognized by the Nrd1/Nab3 heterodimer followed by the incorporation of the RNA helicase Sen1, which disconnects Nrd1 from the CTD and translocates along the nascent RNA to promote termination

> Whatever the case it is clear that further experiments on Sen1 are needed to unveil its mechanism. In the meantime, the Alphafold structure can help to propose new hypotheses and design biochemical experiments to test them.
