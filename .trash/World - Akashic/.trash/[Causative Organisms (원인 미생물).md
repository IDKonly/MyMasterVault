At present, over 28 hantaviruses that cause disease in humans, ranging from acute renal failure to pulmonary oedema and severe haemorrhagic illness, have been identiﬁed around the world. While around 1000 HCPS cases have been reported, it is estimated that more than 100 000 HFRS cases occur worldwide each year. In many countries hantaviral infections are undetected and not reported, so additional hantaviruses may remain undiscovered. Hantaviruses and the diseases they cause deserve the attention of researchers and public health ofﬁcials, and increased clinician awareness with regard to their impact on public health.
