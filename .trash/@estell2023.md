>  
> The transcriptional termination of unstable non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) is poorly understood compared to coding transcripts. We recently identified ZC3H4-WDR82 (“restrictor”) as restricting human ncRNA transcription, but how it does this is unknown. Here, we show that ZC3H4 additionally associates with ARS2 and the nuclear exosome targeting complex. The domains of ZC3H4 that contact ARS2 and WDR82 are required for ncRNA restriction, suggesting their presence in a functional complex. Consistently, ZC3H4, WDR82, and ARS2 co-transcriptionally control an overlapping population of ncRNAs. ZC3H4 is proximal to the negative elongation factor, PNUTS, which we show enables restrictor function and is required to terminate the transcription of all major RNA polymerase II transcript classes. In contrast to short ncRNAs, longer protein-coding transcription is supported by U1 snRNA, which shields transcripts from restrictor and PNUTS at hundreds of genes. These data provide important insights into the mechanism and control of transcription by restrictor and PNUTS.
