	2. 폴란드에서도 발견 (1980)
		1. 북유럽지역에 Nephropathia epidemica(NE)라고 알려진 약한 HRFS가 1930년대부터 알려져 있었음

		2. HCPS의 원인 바이러스는 Sin Nombre virus(SNV), Andes virus(ANDV)라고 보고되었음.
	5. HRFS와 HCPS의 분리
		1. 병리학적 특징 (아마 이부분이 아니라 좀 후술해야할듯)
			1. 이  질병의 치사율은 12%(HFRS)에서 40%(HCPS)임.
			2. HFRS는 신부전과 점상출혈부터 심각한 내출혈까지 다양한 출혈성 징후가 특징이고

			4. 둘이 공통적으로 미세혈관 내피의 투과성 증가를 일으킴
			5. 한타바이러스 감염에 의한 증상은 세포병리학적인 이유로 발생하는 것이 아니라 인간의 면역체계가 중요한 역할을 하는 것으로 보임

			1. Person-to-person transmission was considered unlikely until 1996, when reports regarding transmission of ANDV in an HCPS outbreak in Argentina changed this perception
			2. 사람 간 전파는 1996년 아르헨티나에서 발생한 HCPS 발발에서 ANDV의 전파에 관한 보고서가 이러한 인식을 바꿀 때까지 가능성이 없는 것으로 간주되었습니다.

3. Causative organism
	1. ![[Pasted image 20221123145042.png]]
		1. Several hantaviruses that have been demonstrated to circulate in Europe and Asia belong to the so-called ‘Old World hantaviruses’
		2. A second group of hantaviruses are so-called ‘New World hantavirus’, which were first recognized in 1993, after an outbreak of an acute pulmonary distress syndrome in America.
4. Molecular biology and pathogens
	1. Viral genome
		1. ![[Pasted image 20221123163844.png]]
			1. The genome comprises three negativesense, single-stranded RNAs that share a 30 terminal sequence of the genome segments. The three segments, S (small), M (medium) and L (large), encode the nucleoprotein (N), envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc), and the L protein or viral RNA-depended RNA polymerase, respectively [9].
			2. The genome comprises **three negativesense**, **single-stranded RNAs**
				1. S ; nucleoprotein (N)
				2. M ; envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc)
				3. L ; L protein or viral RNA-depended RNA polymerase(RdRp)
			3. Like other enveloped viruses, hantaviruses are readily inactivated by heat (30 min at 60C), detergents, UV irradiation, organic solvents and hypochlorite solutions.
			4. Hantaviruses infect endothelial, epithelial, dendritic and lymphocyte cells by the attachment of the viral glycoprotein to the cell surface receptors.
				1. it is considered that [[β1-integrin]] interacts with viral Gn of apathogenic hantaviruses, while [[β3-integrin]] interacts with the glycoprotein of pathogenic hantaviruses
	2. Infection mechanism
		1. ![[Pasted image 20221123163800.png]]
		2. Hantaviruses infect endothelial, epithelial, dendritic and lymphocyte cells by the attachment of the viral glycoprotein to the cell surface receptors.
			1. it is considered that [[β1-integrin]] interacts with viral Gn of apathogenic hantaviruses, while [[β3-integrin]] interacts with the glycoprotein of pathogenic hantaviruses
		3. Hantaviruses replicate in the cytoplasm and the glycoproteins are targeted to the Golgi complex, where most hantaviruses bud.
			1. However, SNV(Sin Nombre virus) has been shown to bud at the plasma membrane.
	3. Pathogenesis
		1. ![[Pasted image 20221123173446.png]]
			1. vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF) ; 혈관내피성장인자
			2. bradykinin and cytokines
				1. 브래디키닌은 모세혈관의 투과성을 증가시켜 백혈구의 유출을 일으키는 생리활성펩티드이다. 평활근을 천천히 수축시키는 작용이 있기 때문에 brady + kinin이라고 명명하였다.
			3. thrombocytopenia; 혈소판 감소증
			4. Coagulation; 응고
		2. HFRS and HCPS have an overlapping pathophysiology consisting of increased vascular permeability(혈관투과성), platelet activation(혈소판 활성화) and an overreacting host immune response(면역과민)
			1. Differences in disease are reflected by the different vascular beds that are primarily infected—renal medulla or pulmonary capillaries. However, the mechanisms mediating cell tropism and organ-specific dysfunction during HFRS and HCPS remain unknown
				1. HFRS와 HCPS의 차이는 서로 다른 혈관상에 감염된다는 것에 의해 발생합니다. 그러나 이 둘이 어떻게 장기에 특이적으로 작용하는지는 알려지지 않았습니다.
		3. The pathophysiology of capillary leakage is characterized by the disruption of endothelial cell–cell contacts.
			1. Hantaviruses primarily infect and replicate in endothelial cells of capillaries; 한타바이러스는 모세혈관 내막에서 1차감염을 일으키고 복제됩니다.
			2. however, there are few to no direct cytopathic effects to the endothelium as detected in histological samples; 하지만 세포병리학적인 효과는 아주 적거나 없습니다.
		4. it is hypothesized that the breakdown of endothelial cell-to-cell contact is mainly caused by the release of vasoactive factors **rather than endothelial cell death**
		5. Interestingly, the ability of hantaviruses to infect endothelial cells is shared with many (emerging) viruses
			1. Hence dysregulation in vascular function contributes significantly to pathophysiology in many life-threatening viral infections and our growing knowledge due to the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may promote research advances for hantavirus disease
		6. In NE patients the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte response enhanced the number of activated CD8þ T cells and reversed CD4þ versus CD8þ T-cell ratio, which coincides with the onset of clinical disease
		7. A mixed pattern of T helper type 1 and T helper type 2 immune response patterns, high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and their insufficient suppression by regulatory cytokines leads to the harmful effect of immune response in HFRS-infected patients
5. Symptoms (병리학적 특징?)
	1. ![[Pasted image 20221123144027.png]]
	2. A typical course of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS)
		1. Incubation period (잠복기)
		2. Febrile phase (발열기)
		3. Hypotensive (저혈압)
		4. Oliguric (핍뇨기)
		5. Polyuric (다뇨기)
		6. Convalescent (회복기)
	3. 이  질병의 치사율은 12%(HFRS)에서 40%(HCPS)임.
	4. HFRS is characterized by renal failure and haemorrhagic manifestations that vary from petechiae to severe internal bleeding.; HFRS는 신부전과 점상출혈부터 심각한 내출혈까지 다양한 출혈성 징후가 특징이고
	5. Pneumonia and cardiovascular dysfunction are characteristics of HCPS.; HCPS는 심폐기능장애 특징임
	6. Increased permeability of microvascular endothelium seems to be a common effect of hantavirus infection.; 둘이 공통적으로 미세혈관 내피의 투과성 증가를 일으킴
	7. 한타바이러스 감염에 의한 증상은 세포병리학적인 이유로 발생하는 것이 아니라 인간의 면역체계가 중요한 역할을 하는 것으로 보임

6. Diagnosis
	1. The diagnosis of HFRS and HCPS is based on **clinical and epidemiological data** and **laboratory tests.**
		1. However, it is almost impossible to diagnose hantavirus infections solely on clinical grounds, especially in cases with mild and moderate clinical symptoms, as the early signs of the disease are non-specific.
	2. Laboratory diagnosis of acute hantavirus infections is based on serology as virtually all patients have IgM and usually also IgG antibodies present in serum at the onset of symptoms.
		1. ELISA
		2. detection of hantavirus genome in blood or serum samples by RT-PCR.
			1. In addition, with detection of viral RNA, hantavirus infection has been confirmed even before the presence of specific antibodies
		
7. Treatment and prevention
	1. Treatment
		1. At present, no specific U.S. Food and Drug Administrationapproved therapy is available for either HFRS or HCPS
			1. the treatment is primarily supportive. It is recommended that patients with HCPS and severe HFRS should be moved to an intensive care unit for close monitoring and care.
	2. Prevention
		1. Caution
			1. One of the major risk factors for infection is living close to forested areas and cleaning up around houses or sheds.
				1. In addition, occupational exposures, such as construction or forest workers, farmers and soldiers are at increased risk
			2. The preventive measures are based mainly on rodent control, reducing rodents' shelter and food sources near human housing, eliminating rodents inside homes and avoiding contact with potentially contaminated areas.
		2. Vaccine
			1. the only way of minimizing the risk of hantavirus disease could be effective vaccines, but up to now no vaccines were approved for wide use in Europe or the USA.
			2. In Asia, the **Republic of Korea**, Hantavax® has been used for a number of years. The vaccine is derived from **formalin-inactivated HTNV-infected suckling mouse brain**, but frequent booster doses are needed for protective immunity
			3. In **China**, several different **formalininactivated vaccines from animal tissues** have been produced and used, but none has been approved for use in European countries.
			4. Apart from that, only two molecular vaccines against HFRS have been tested in humans, the first was recombinant **vaccinia-vectored vaccine** expressing the **M segment of HTNV** and **the second plasmid DNA.**
