Abstract
---
The subtelomeres, highly heterogeneous repeated sequences neighboring telomeres, are transcribed into coding and noncoding RNAs in a variety of organisms. Telomereproximal subtelomeric regions produce non-coding transcripts i.e., ARRET, αARRET, subTERRA, and TERRA, which function in telomere maintenance. The role and molecular mechanisms of the majority of subtelomeric transcripts remain unknown. This review depicts the current knowledge and puts into perspective the results obtained in different models from yeasts to humans.,

              The subtelomeres are highly heterogeneous repeated sequences next to telomeres.

              They are transcribed into coding and noncoding (nc)RNAs in a variety of organisms.

              The subtelomeric ncRNAs ARRET, αARRET, subTERRA and TERRA maintain telomere.
