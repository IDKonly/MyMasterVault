  {"id":"arndt2015","abstract":"The RNA polymerase II transcription cycle is often divided into three major stages: initiation, elongation, and termination. Research over the last decade has blurred these divisions and emphasized the tightly regulated transitions that occur as RNA polymerase II synthesizes a transcript from start to finish. Transcription termination, the process that marks the end of transcription elongation, is regulated by proteins that interact with the polymerase, nascent transcript, and/or chromatin template. The failure to terminate transcription can cause accumulation of aberrant transcripts and interfere with transcription at downstream genes. Here, we review the mechanism, regulation, and physiological impact of a termination pathway that targets small noncoding transcripts produced by RNA polymerase II. We emphasize the Nrd1–Nab3–Sen1 pathway in yeast, in which the process has been extensively studied. The importance of understanding small RNA termination pathways is underscored by the need to control noncoding transcription in eukaryotic genomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Arndt","given":"Karen M."},{"family":"Reines","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"arndt2015","container-title":"Annual Review of Biochemistry","DOI":"10.1146/annurev-biochem-060614-034457","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-biochem-060614-034457","page":"381-404","PMID":"25747400","source":"Annual Reviews","title":"Termination of Transcription of Short Noncoding RNAs by RNA Polymerase II","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-biochem-060614-034457","volume":"84"},
  {"id":"Avsic-Zupanc2019","abstract":"Over the past few decades understanding and recognition of hantavirus infection has greatly improved worldwide, but both the amplitude and the magnitude of hantavirus outbreaks have been increasing. Several novel hantaviruses with unknown pathogenic potential have been identified in a variety of insectivore hosts. With the new hosts, new geographical distributions of hantaviruses have also been discovered and several new species were found in Africa. Hantavirus infection in humans can result in two clinical syndromes: haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) caused by Old World and New World hantaviruses, respectively. The clinical presentation of HFRS varies from subclinical, mild, and moderate to severe, depending in part on the causative agent of the disease. In general, HFRS caused by Hantaan virus, Amur virus and Dobrava virus are more severe with mortality rates from 5 to 15%, whereas Seoul virus causes moderate and Puumala virus and Saaremaa virus cause mild forms of disease with mortality rates <1%. The central phenomena behind the pathogenesis of both HFRS and HCPS are increased vascular permeability and acute thrombocytopenia. The pathogenesis is likely to be a complex multifactorial process that includes contributions from immune responses, platelet dysfunction and the deregulation of endothelial cell barrier functions. Also a genetic predisposition, related to HLA type, seems to be important for the severity of the disease. As there is no effective treatment or vaccine approved for use in the USA and Europe, public awareness and precautionary measures are the only ways to minimize the risk of hantavirus disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Avšič-Županc","given":"T."},{"family":"Saksida","given":"A."},{"family":"Korva","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"Avsic-Zupanc2019","container-title":"Clinical Microbiology and Infection","container-title-short":"Clinical Microbiology and Infection","DOI":"10.1111/1469-0691.12291","ISSN":"1198-743X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,4,1]]},"language":"en","page":"e6-e16","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Hantavirus infections","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X15005364","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"ellahi2015","abstract":"Saccharomyces cerevisiae telomeres have been a paradigm for studying telomere position effects on gene expression. Telomere position effect was first described in yeast by its effect on the expression of reporter genes inserted adjacent to truncated telomeres. The reporter genes showed variable silencing that depended on the Sir2/3/4 complex. Later studies examining subtelomeric reporter genes inserted at natural telomeres hinted that telomere position effects were less pervasive than previously thought. Additionally, more recent data using the sensitive technology of chromatin immunoprecipitation and massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-Seq) revealed a discrete and noncontinuous pattern of coenrichment for all three Sir proteins at a few telomeres, calling the generality of these conclusions into question. Here we combined the ChIP-Seq of the Sir proteins with RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in wild-type and in SIR2, SIR3, and SIR4 deletion mutants to characterize the chromatin and transcriptional landscape of all native S. cerevisiae telomeres at the highest achievable resolution. Most S. cerevisiae chromosomes had subtelomeric genes that were expressed, with only ∼6% of subtelomeric genes silenced in a SIR-dependent manner. In addition, we uncovered 29 genes with previously unknown cell-type-specific patterns of expression.

Efficient synthesis of the TTGGGG repeats depended only on addition of micromolar concentrations of oligomer primer, dGTP, and dTTP to the extract. The activity was sensitive to heat and proteinase K treatment.

Inspection of the sequence reveals the presence of 12 tandem direct repeats, each 36 nucleotides long and having nearly identical sequence. Each 36 base-pair repeat can be further subdivided into three tandem sub-repeats of a similar 12 base-pair sequence. Analysis of total genomic yeast DNA from several strains by Southern hybridization suggests that the number of tandem 36 base-pair repeat units may vary from approximately 8 to 25 among different telomeric regions. Differences in the number of repeats may have arisen by unequal crossing over between them.

  {"id":"huffines2022","abstract":"One of the first steps in ribosome biogenesis is transcription of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) by RNA polymerase I (Pol I). Processing of the resultant ribosomal RNA (rRNA) begins co-transcriptionally and perturbation of Pol I transcription elongation results in defective rRNA processing. Mechanistic insight regarding the link between transcription elongation and ribosome assembly is lacking due to limited in vivo methods to assay Pol I transcription. Here, we use native elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq) with a strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae containing a point mutation in Pol I, rpa190-F1205H, which results in impaired rRNA processing and ribosome assembly. We previously demonstrated that this mutation caused a mild reduction in the transcription elongation rate of Pol I in vitro, however, transcription elongation by the mutant has not been characterized in vivo. Here, our findings demonstrate that the mutant Pol I has an increased pause propensity during processive transcription elongation both in vitro and in vivo. NET-seq reveals that rpa190-F1205H Pol I displays alternative pause site preferences in vivo. Specifically, the mutant is sensitized to A/G residues in the RNA:DNA hybrid and at the last incorporated nucleotide position. Furthermore, both NET-seq and EM analysis of Miller chromatin spreads reveal pileups of rpa190-F1205H Pol I throughout the rDNA, particularly at the 5’ end of the 35S gene. This combination of in vitro and in vivo analyses of the Pol I mutant provides novel insights into Pol I elongation properties and indicates how these properties are crucial for efficient co-transcriptional rRNA processing and ribosome assembly.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Huffines","given":"Abigail K."},{"family":"Engel","given":"Krysta L."},{"family":"French","given":"Sarah L."},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Yinfeng"},{"family":"Viktorovskaya","given":"Olga V."},{"family":"Schneider","given":"David A."}],"citation-key":"huffines2022","container-title":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","container-title-short":"Journal of Biological Chemistry","DOI":"10.1016/j.jbc.2022.102730","ISSN":"0021-9258","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,22]]},"language":"en","page":"102730","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Rate of transcription elongation and sequence-specific pausing by RNA polymerase I directly influence ribosomal RNA processing","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925822011735"},

Satellite DNA repeat sequences are useful markers for karyotyping, but have a more enigmatic role in the eukaryotic cell. Much work has been done to investigate the structure and arrangement of repetitive DNA elements in classical models with implications for species evolution. Still more is needed until there is a complete picture of the biological function of DNA satellite sequences, particularly when considering non-model organisms. Celebrating Gregor Mendel's anniversary by going to the roots, this review is designed to inspire and aid new research into telomeres and satellites with a particular focus on non-model organisms and accessible experimental and in silico methods that do not require specialized equipment or expensive materials. We describe how to identify telomere (and satellite) repeats giving many examples of published (and some unpublished) data from these techniques to illustrate the principles behind the experiments. We also present advice on how to perform and analyse such experiments, including details of common pitfalls. Our examples are a selection of recent developments and underexplored areas of research from the past. As a nod to Mendel's early work, we use many examples from plants and insects, especially as much recent work has expanded beyond the human and yeast models traditional in telomere research.

In humans, hantaviral pathology is characterized by the disruption of the endothelial cell barrier followed by increased capillary permeability, thrombocytopenia due to platelet activation/depletion and an overactive immune response. Genetic vulnerability due to certain human leukocyte antigen haplotypes is associated with disease severity. Typically, two different hantavirus-caused clinical syndromes have been reported: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). The primarily affected vascular beds differ in these two entities: renal medullary capillaries in HFRS caused by Old World hantaviruses and pulmonary capillaries in HCPS caused by New World hantaviruses. Disease severity in HFRS ranges from mild, e.g. Puumala virus-associated nephropathia epidemica, to moderate, e.g. Hantaan or Dobrava virus infections. HCPS leads to a severe acute respiratory distress syndrome with high mortality rates. Due to novel insights into organ tropism, hantavirus-associated pathophysiology and overlapping clinical features, HFRS and HCPS are believed to be interconnected syndromes frequently involving the kidneys. As there are no specific antiviral treatments or vaccines approved in Europe or the USA, only preventive measures and public awareness may minimize the risk of hantavirus infection.

  {"id":"louis1995","abstract":"Yeast chromosome ends are similar in structure and function to chromosome ends in most, if not all, eukaryotic organisms. There is a G-rich terminal repeat at the ends which is maintained by telomerase. In addition to the classical functions of protecting the end from degradation and end-to-end fusions, and completing replication, yeast telomeres have several interesting properties including: non-nucleosomal chromatin structure; transcriptional position effect variegation for genes with adjacent telomeres; nuclear peripheral localization; apparent physical clustering; non-random recombinational interactions. A number of genes have been identified that are involved in modifying one or more of these properties. These include genes involved in general DNA metabolism, chromatin structure and telomere maintenance. Adjacent to the terminal repeat is a mosaic of middle repetitive elements that exhibit a great deal of polymorphism both between individual strains and among different chromosome ends. Much of the sequence redundancy in the yeast genome is found in the sub-telomeric regions (within the last 25 kb of each end). The sub-telomeric regions are generally low in gene density, low in transcription, low in recombination, and they are late replicating. The only element which appears to be shared by all chromosome ends is part of the previously defined X element containing an ARS consensus. Most of the ‘core’ X elements also contain an Abf1p binding site and a URS1-like element, which may have consequences for the chromatin structure, nuclear architecture and transcription of native telomeres. Possible functions of sub-telomeric repeats include: fillers for increasing chromosome size to some minimum threshold level necessary for chromosome stability; barrier against transcriptional silencing; a suitable region for adaptive amplification of genes; secondary mechanism of telomere maintenance via recombination when telomerase activity is absent.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Louis","given":"Edward J."}],"citation-key":"louis1995","container-title":"Yeast","DOI":"10.1002/yea.320111604","ISSN":"1097-0061","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[[1995]]},"language":"en","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/yea.320111604","page":"1553-1573","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The chromosome ends of Saccharomyces cerevisiae","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/yea.320111604","volume":"11"},

None of the proteins identified were previously implicated in regulation at telomeres, yet genomic and proteomic studies reveal that a subset of factors show many interactions with established telomere binding complexes. For many factors, the subtelomeric binding pattern is dynamic and undergoes flux toward or away from the telomere as physiological conditions shift. We find that subtelomeric binding is dependent on environmental conditions and correlates with the induction of gene expression in response to stress.

The in vivo ChEC method used herein in conjunction with several proteins in a natural context revealed no evidence for such structures in bulk chromatin.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Our study allows a structural definition of the chromatin found at chromosome ends in budding yeast. This definition, derived with direct in vivo approaches, includes a terminal area that is free of nucleosomes, certain positioned nucleosomes and conserved DNA-bound protein complexes. This organization of subtelomeric and telomeric areas however does not include a telomeric cis-loopback conformation. We propose that the observations on such fold-back structures may report rare and/or transient associations and not stable or constitutive structures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Pasquier","given":"Emeline"},{"family":"Wellinger","given":"Raymund J."}],"citation-key":"pasquier2020","container-title":"Epigenetics & Chromatin","container-title-short":"Epigenetics & Chromatin","DOI":"10.1186/s13072-020-00344-w","ISSN":"1756-8935","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12]]},"language":"en","page":"23","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"In vivo chromatin organization on native yeast telomeric regions is independent of a cis-telomere loopback conformation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://epigeneticsandchromatin.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13072-020-00344-w","volume":"13"},

By determining the cellular fate of the generated transcripts, transcription termination pathways shape the transcriptome. Recent reports have underscored the crucial role of these pathways in limiting the extent of pervasive transcription, which has attracted interest in post-initiation events in gene expression control. Transcription termination pathways involved in the production of non-coding RNAs - such as the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 (NNS) pathway in yeast and the cap-binding complex (CBC)-ARS2 pathway in humans - are key determinants of transcription quality control. Understanding the mechanisms leading to the timely and efficient dismantling of elongation complexes remains a major unmet challenge, but new insights into the molecular basis of termination at mRNA-coding and non-coding RNA gene targets have been gained in eukaryotes.","author":[{"family":"Porrua","given":"Odil"},{"family":"Libri","given":"Domenico"}],"citation-key":"porrua2015","container-title":"Nature Reviews.

  {"id":"stajic2019","abstract":"Epigenetic, non-DNA sequence-based inheritance can potentially contribute to adaptation but, due to its transient nature and the difficulty involved in uncoupling it from genetic variation, it is unclear whether it has any effect on long-term evolution. However, short-term epigenetic inheritance may interact with genetic change by modifying the rate and type of adaptive mutations. Here, we test this notion in an experimental evolution set-up in yeast. We tune low, intermediate and high levels of heritable silencing of a URA3 reporter under selection by insertion at different positions within silent subtelomeric chromatin in otherwise isogenic Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Heritable silencing does not impact mutation rate but drives population size expansion and rapid epigenetic adaptation. This eventually leads to genetic assimilation of the silent phenotype by mutations that reduce or abolish URA3 expression. Moreover, at intermediate or low levels of heritable silencing we find that populations evolve more rapidly by accumulation of adaptive mutations, in part through acquisition of novel alleles that enhance gene silencing, aiding accelerated adaptation. We provide an experimental proof of concept that defines the impact and mechanisms of how short-term epigenetic inheritance can shape adaptive evolution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Stajic","given":"Dragan"},{"family":"Perfeito","given":"Lília"},{"family":"Jansen","given":"Lars E.

The complicated structure and dynamics of heterochromatin have rendered it difficult to characterize. In budding yeast, heterochromatin assembly requires the SIR proteins—Sir3, believed to be the primary structural component of SIR heterochromatin, and the Sir2–4 complex, responsible for the targeted recruitment of SIR proteins and the deacetylation of lysine 16 of histone H4. Previously, we found that Sir3 binds but does not compact nucleosomal arrays. Here we reconstitute chromatin fibers with the complete complement of SIR proteins and use sedimentation velocity, molecular modeling, and atomic force microscopy to characterize the stoichiometry and conformation of SIR chromatin fibers. In contrast to fibers with Sir3 alone, our results demonstrate that SIR arrays are highly compact. Strikingly, the condensed structure of SIR heterochromatin fibers requires both the integrity of H4K16 and an interaction between Sir3 and Sir4. We propose a model in which a dimer of Sir3 bridges and stabilizes two adjacent nucleosomes, while a Sir2–4 heterotetramer interacts with Sir3 associated with a nucleosomal trimer, driving fiber compaction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Swygert","given":"Sarah G."},{"family":"Senapati","given":"Subhadip"},{"family":"Bolukbasi","given":"Mehmet F."},{"family":"Wolfe","given":"Scot A."},{"family":"Lindsay","given":"Stuart"},{"family":"Peterson","given":"Craig L."}],"citation-key":"swygert2018","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

  {"id":"wahlin2000","abstract":"A wide divergence has been detected in the telomeric sequences among budding yeast species. Despite their length and homogeneity differences, all these yeast telomeric sequences show a conserved core which closely matches the consensus RAP1-binding sequence. We demonstrate that the RAP1 protein binds this sequence core, without involving the diverged sequences outside the core. In Saccharomyces castellii and Saccharomyces dairensis specific classes of interspersed variant repeats are present. We show here that a RAP1-binding site is formed in these species by connecting two consecutive 8 bp telomeric repeats. DNase I footprint analyses specify the binding site as the 13 bp sequence CTGGGTGTCTGGG. The RAP1 protein also binds the variant repeats, although with a lowered affinity. However, a split footprint is produced when RAP1 binds a variant repeat where the two half-sites of the binding site are separated by an additional 6 nt. This is probably caused by the intervening sequence looping out of the RAP1–DNA complex. We suggest that the bipartite subdomain structure of the RAP1 protein allows it to remodel telomeric chromatin, a feature which may be of great relevance for telomeric chromatin assembly and structure in vivo.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Wahlin","given":"Johan"},{"family":"Cohn","given":"Marita"}],"citation-key":"wahlin2000","container-title":"Nucleic Acids Research","container-title-short":"Nucleic Acids Res","ISSN":"0305-1048","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000,6,15]]},"page":"2292-2301","PMCID":"PMC102728","PMID":"10871358","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAP1 binds to telomeric sequences with spatial flexibility","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC102728/","volume":"28"},
  {"id":"Wang2019","abstract":"DNA replication initiates from multiple replication origins (ORIs) in eukaryotes. Discovery and characterization of replication origins are essential for a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of DNA replication. In this study, the features of autonomously replicating sequences (ARSs) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been comprehensively analyzed as follows. Firstly, we carried out the analysis of the ARSs available in S. cerevisiae S288C. By evaluating the sequence similarity of experimentally established ARSs, we found that 94.32% of ARSs are unique across the whole genome of S. cerevisiae S288C and those with high sequence similarity are prone to locate in subtelomeres. Subsequently, we built a non-redundant dataset with a total of 520 ARSs, which are based on ARSs annotation of S. cerevisiae S288C from SGD and then supplemented with those from OriDB and DeOri databases. We conducted a large-scale comparison of ORIs among the diverse budding yeast strains from a population genomics perspective. We found that 82.7% of ARSs are not only conserved in genomic sequence but also relatively conserved in chromosomal position. The non-conserved ARSs tend to distribute in the subtelomeric regions. We also conducted a pan-genome analysis of ARSs among the S. cerevisiae strains, and a total of 183 core ARSs existing in all yeast strains were determined. We extracted the genes adjacent to replication origins among the 104 yeast strains to examine whether there are differences in their gene functions. The result showed that the genes involved in the initiation of DNA replication, such as orc3, mcm2, mcm4, mcm6, and cdc45, are conservatively located adjacent to the replication origins. Furthermore, we found the genes adjacent to conserved ARSs are significantly enriched in DNA binding, enzyme activity, transportation, and energy, whereas for the genes adjacent to non-conserved ARSs are significantly enriched in response to environmental stress, metabolites biosynthetic process and biosynthesis of antibiotics. In general, we characterized the replication origins from the genome-wide and population genomics perspectives, which would provide new insights into the replication mechanism of S. cerevisiae and facilitate the design of algorithms to identify genome-wide replication origins in yeast.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Feng"}],"citation-key":"Wang2019","container-title":"Frontiers in Microbiology","ISSN":"1664-302X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019]]},"source":"Frontiers","title":"Comprehensive Analysis of Replication Origins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Genomes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2019.02122","volume":"10"},
