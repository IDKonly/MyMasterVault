1. Sanger seqeuencing
	1. Sanger seqeuencing uses DNA polymerase to make new DNA
	2. A recombinant plasmid is a good template for sanger seqeuncing
	3. Sanger sequencing generates a series of single stranded DAN fragments
	4. Incorporation of a dideoxynucleotide(ddNTP) terminates DNA synthesis
	5. Nested fragments are separated by size using eletrophoresis
	6. Each ddNTP is lebeled with a different fluorescent dye for detection of the seqeunce
	7. Automated DNA seqeuncing
2. Next generation sequencing
	1. DNA sequnece trance and inferred DNA sequence from automated sanger seqeuencing
	2. DNA sequencing generation
		1. 1st gen
		2. 2nd gen ; Massively incresed throughput
			1. pyrosequencing ;Roche 454
			2. Illumina-Solexa sequencing(일루미나)
		3. 3rd gen ; Direct seqeuncing of single DNA molecule
			1. SMRT PacBio seqeuncing
				1. read length : 50kbp
3. Seqeuncing genomes
	1. genome comparisons
4. Sequencing of genomes
	1. Human genome project
	2. Genome seqeuncing project
	3. Genome projects and the development of our current information library
	4. Human genome project began using the hierarchical strategy (계층적 전략)
	5. celera developed the whole genome shotgun strategy for genome seqeuncing
		1. Hierachical short gun seqeuncing
			1. Genomic DNA
			2. BAC library
			3. Organized mapped large clone contigs
			4. BAC to be seqeunced
			5. Shotgun clones
			6. shotgun seqeunce
			7. Assembly
				1. paired end seqeunces direct correct assembly of unique seqeunces flanking repeats
				2. repeats prevent correct assembly of single shotgun sequence reads
				3. each shotgun clone was partially seqeunced from both ends
5. **Terminology (중요)**
