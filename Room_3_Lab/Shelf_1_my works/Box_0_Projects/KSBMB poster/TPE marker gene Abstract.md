Telomeres have been a good model for studying heterochromatin structure. Position effect is a gene silencing phenomenon that is affected by heterochromatin blocks that are distributed across the chromosome. Because telomeres are also heterochromatin blocks, they exhibit a position effect, which is called telomere position effect (TPE, or telomeric silencing). TPE is not a specific effect on genes or telomeres. The Sir complex is one of the major proteins that form heterochromatin near telomeres in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When Sir2, one of the components of the Sir complex, is absent, telomeric silencing is defective. Due to the high cost of the assays like URA3 assay previously used for TPE screening and the critical question, there is a need to replace or complement them with methods to detect telomeric silencing. In our study, we select 6 marker genes that have significantly altered gene expression when changes Sir complex from RNA sequencing data of WT and Δsir2. The six marker genes we found will provide a quick and easy way to screen for genes that may affect TPE using qRT-PCR, which is commonly used in research labs.

## Paraphrasing 

1. Telomeres have been a good model for studying heterochromatin structure. 
	1. [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]의 [[1_a Telomere|Telomere]]는 고유한 특징 때문에 [[Heterochromatin]]연구에 유용한 모델입니다.
2. Position effect is a gene silencing phenomenon that is affected by heterochromatin blocks that are distributed across the chromosome. 
3. Because telomeres are also heterochromatin blocks, they exhibit a position effect, which is called telomere position effect (TPE, or telomeric silencing). 
	1. TPE is not a specific effect on genes or telomeres. 
	2. [[1_a Telomere|Telomere]]는 [[Heterochromatin]] block이기 때문에 특정하지 않은 주변 유전자를 silencing 시키는 telomere position effect를 일으킵니다.
4. The Sir complex is one of the major proteins that form heterochromatin near telomeres in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 
	1. [[SIR complex]]는 [[1_a Telomere|Telomere]]의 heterochromatin 구조를 형성하는 주요한 단백질입니다.
	2. SIR complex는 결합 원점으로부터 spreading하는 mechanism을 가지고 있다는 특징 때문에 telomere 근처에서 일어나는 telomeric silencing의 원인이 됩니다.
5. When Sir2, one of the components of the Sir complex, is absent, telomeric silencing is defective.
	1. Spreading을 주도하는 Sir2 단백질이 없으면, 부족한(lacking) telomere position effect를 보입니다.  
6. Due to the high cost of the assays like URA3 assay previously used for TPE screening and the critical question, there is a need to replace or complement them with methods to detect telomeric silencing. 
	1. Because of the high cost of prior TPE screening assays, such as the URA3 assay, and the crucial issue, there is a need to replace or supplement them with methods to detect telomeric silencing. 
7. In our study, we select 6 marker genes that have significantly altered gene expression when changes Sir complex from RNA sequencing data of WT and Δsir2. 
	1. We chose six marker genes from RNA sequencing data of WT and Δsir2 that had significantly altered gene expression when the Sir complex changes. 
8. The six marker genes we found will provide a quick and easy way to screen for genes that may affect TPE using qRT-PCR, which is commonly used in research labs.
	1. The six marker genes we identified will allow us to explore for genes that may affect TPE using qRT-PCR, which is widely utilized in research labs.
