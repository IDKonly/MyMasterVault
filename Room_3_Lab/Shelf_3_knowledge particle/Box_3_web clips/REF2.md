[Gene Ontology Details](https://www.yeastgenome.org/locus/S000002603/go)

## Gene Ontology[](https://www.yeastgenome.org/locus/S000002603#)

GO Annotations consist of four mandatory components: a gene product, a term from one of the three [Gene Ontology (GO)](http://geneontology.org/) controlled vocabularies ([Molecular Function](https://www.yeastgenome.org/ontology/go/molecular_function), [Biological Process](https://www.yeastgenome.org/ontology/go/biological_process), and [Cellular Component](https://www.yeastgenome.org/ontology/go/cellular_component)), a reference, and an evidence code. SGD has manually curated and high-throughput GO Annotations, both derived from the literature, as well as computational, or predicted, annotations. Click "Gene Ontology Details" to view all GO information and evidence for this locus as well as biological processes it shares with other genes.

---

## Complex[](https://www.yeastgenome.org/locus/S000002603#)

Macromolecular complex annotations are imported from the [Complex Portal](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/complexportal/home). These annotations have been derived from physical molecular interaction evidence extracted from the literature and cross-referenced in the entry, or by curator inference from information on homologs in closely related species or by inference from scientific background.

[Phenotype Details](https://www.yeastgenome.org/locus/S000002603/phenotype)

## Phenotype[](https://www.yeastgenome.org/locus/S000002603#)

Phenotype annotations for a gene are curated single mutant phenotypes that require an observable (e.g., "cell shape"), a qualifier (e.g., "abnormal"), a mutant type (e.g., null), strain background, and a reference. In addition, annotations are classified as classical genetics or high-throughput (e.g., large scale survey, systematic mutation set). Whenever possible, allele information and additional details are provided. Click "Phenotype Details" to view all phenotype annotations and evidence for this locus as well as phenotypes it shares with other genes.

[Expression Details](https://www.yeastgenome.org/locus/S000002603/expression)

## Expression[](https://www.yeastgenome.org/locus/S000002603#)

Expression data are derived from records contained in the [Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), and are first log2 transformed and normalized. Referenced datasets may contain one or more condition(s), and as a result there may be a greater number of conditions than datasets represented in a single clickable histogram bar. The histogram division at 0.0 separates the down-regulated (green) conditions and datasets from those that are up-regulated (red).
