1. Histones: These are a family of proteins that are responsible for packaging DNA into chromatin. There are five major types of histones (H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4), and they are associated with chromosomal structure and function.
2. [[Cohesin complex]]: This protein complex is responsible for holding sister chromatids together during cell division and is associated with chromatin.
3. Condensin complex: This protein complex plays a role in chromosome condensation during mitosis and meiosis and is associated with chromatin.
4. Chromatin remodeling complexes: These are a group of protein complexes that modify chromatin structure, including nucleosome positioning and histone modifications. Examples include SWI/SNF and ISWI complexes.
5. Chromatin modifying enzymes: These are enzymes that add or remove chemical modifications from histones or DNA, affecting chromatin structure and gene expression. Examples include histone acetyltransferases, histone deacetylases, and DNA methyltransferases.
6. Centromere proteins: These proteins are responsible for attaching spindle fibers to chromosomes during cell division and are associated with centromeric chromatin.
7. [[1_a Telomere|Telomere]] proteins: These proteins are responsible for protecting the ends of chromosomes from degradation and are associated with telomeric chromatin.\
8. DNA repair and recombination proteins: These proteins are responsible for repairing DNA damage and promoting DNA recombination. Examples include Rad51 and BRCA2.
9. RNA polymerase II and transcription factors: These proteins are responsible for transcribing protein-coding genes and are associated with euchromatic chromatin.
10. Proteins involved in DNA replication: These proteins are responsible for the duplication of DNA during cell division and are associated with chromosomal structure and function.
