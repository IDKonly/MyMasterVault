Same as [[Elution volume]] 

From the chromatogram, the elution volume (V<sub>e</sub>), often referred to as the retention volume (V<sub>R</sub>), of a molecule is obtained. As shown in Figure, there are three different ways of measuring V<sub>e</sub> depending on the volume of sample applied to the column.
