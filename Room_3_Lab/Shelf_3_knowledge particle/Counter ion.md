Ion ofopposite charge that interacts with an [[Ion exchange chromatography (IEX)]] resin after [[Column equilibration]]. The [[Counter ion]] is displaced by a protein that binds to the ion exchanger. If a high concentration of the coundter ion is applied, it will compete with the bound protein and elute it from the chromatography column.
