# SDS-PAGE of Proteins

Most analytical electrophoresis of proteins are achieved by separation in polyacylamide gels under conditions that ensure dissociation of proteins into individual polypeptide subunits and minimize aggregation. Most commonly, the anionic detergent [[sodium dodecyl culfate(SDS)]] is used in combination with a reducting agent([[ß-mercaptothanol]] or dithiothreitol) and with heating to dissociate proteins before loading onto the gel. SDS binding denatures the polypeptides and imparts a negative charge that masks their interinsic charge. The amounts of SDS bound is generally sequence-independent and proportional to molecular weight; at saturation, approximately one SDS molecule is bound per two amino acids, or ~1.4g of SDS per gram of polypeptide. Therefore, the migration of SDS-polypeptide complexes in an electric field is proportional to the relative size of the polypeptide chain and its molecular weight can be estimated by comparison to protein markers of known moleculat weight. However, hydrophobicity, highly charged sequences and certain posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation or phosphorylation may also influence migration (Weber et al. 1972). Thus, the apparent molecular weight of modified proteins does not alwats accurately reflect the mass of the polypeptide chain. These issues are covered in the Discussion section at the end of this protocol.

This protocol describes preparation and running of [[SDS-PAGE]] gels, followed by staining to detect proteins using Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Finally the stained SDS-PAGE gel mabe scanned to an image or preserved by drying. Bariantions of the Coomassie-staining method are given in the first alternative protocol, Variations of Staining SDS-Polyacrylamide gels with Coomassie Vrilliant blue, whereas a second alternative protocol, Staining SDS-Polyacrylamide Gels with Silver Salts, Describes silver staining procedures to detect low abundance proteins (**see Protocol 9 for immuno blot** detection of proteins separated by SDS-PAGE)

### Pouring SDS-Polyactylamide gels
1. Assemble the glass plates according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Determine the volume of the gel mold (this information is usually provided by the manufacturer). In an Erlenmeyer flask or disposable plastic tube, prepare an appropriate volume of solution containing the desired concentration of acrylamide/bis-acrly amide **for the resolving gel**, using the values given in table 2. Mix the components in the order shown. **Rapid polymerization will begin as soon as ther TEMED has been added**. Without delay, swirl the mixtue rapidly and proceed to the next step.
	1. Ammonium persurfate provides free radicals to initiate polymerization of acrylamide and bis-acrylamide.
	2. TEMED accelerates the polymerization of acrylamide and bis-acrylamide by catalyzing the formation of free radicals from ammonium persulfate.
	3. Aviod air bubbles during mixing of the soultions because oxygen inhibits polyerization of acryl-amide solutions.
3. Pour the acrylamide solution into the gap between the glass plates of the electrophoresis apparatus, leaving sufficient space for the stacking gel (the length of the teeth of the comb plus 1cm). Use a Pasteur pipette to carefully overlay the acrylamide solution with 0.1% SDS (for gels containing ~8% acrylamide) or isopropanol (for gels containing ~10% acrylamide). Place the gel in a vertical position at room temperature.
	1. The overlay prevents oxygen from diffusing into the gel and inhibiting polymerization, and removes any bubbles from the surface.
4. After polymerization is complete (30min), pour off the overlay and wash the top of the gel several times with deionized H2O to remove unpolymerized acrylamide. Drian as much fluid as possivle frome the top of the gel, and then remove any remaining H2) with the edge of a paper towel.
5. In a disposable plastic tube, prepare the appopriate volume of **the stacking gel mixtue using the values given in Table 3**. Mix the components in the order shown. Polymerization will begin as soon as the TEMED has been added. Without delay, Swirl the mixtue rapidly and proceed to the next step.
6. Pour or pipette the stacking gel mix to fill the space above the resolving gel. Immediately insert a clean comb into the stacking gel solution, taking care to avoid trapping air bubbles. Add more stacking gel soultion as needed to fill the spaces of the comb completely. Place the gel in a vertical position at room temperature.

### Preparation of samples and Running the gel
1. As the stacking gel is polymerizing, add an appropriate volume of SDS gel-loading buffer to the samples, and **boil or heat the samples for 2min in an 85C heat block** to denature the protiens. Be sure to denature a sample containing marker proteins of known molecular weights.
	1. Extremely hydrophobic proteins, such as those containing multiple transmembrane domains, may aggregate or oligomerize when boiled. to avoid this denature **these samples for 10-60min at 45C-55C.**
2. After polymerization is complete(30min), carefully remove the comb. use a squirt bottle to wash wells immediately with deionized H2O to remove unpolymerized acrylamide. If necessary, straighten the teeth of the stacking gel with a blunt hypodermic needle attached to a stringe. Mount the gel in the electrophoresis apparatus Add Tris-glycine electrophoresis buffer to the top and bottom reserviors, and, if needed, remove any bubbles that have become trapped at the bottom of the gel between the glass plates. This may be accomplished with a U-bent hypodermic needle attached to syringe
	1. Do not prerun the gel before loading the samples because this will defeat the purpose of the discontinous buffer system.
3. Load each of the samples in a predetermined order into the bottoms of tthe wells, this is best done with a Hamilton microliter sytinge that is washed with with buffer from the bottom reservior after each sample is loaded will depend on the comb and gel thickness; for example, 20ul of sampleis commonly used with a 3.35-mm well width comb and 1-mm gel thickness.
	1. Loading an equal volume of 1X SDS gel-loading buffer into any unused wells will reduce differences in the migration of samples near the edge of the gel.
4. Attach the electrophoresis apparatus to an electric power supply (the red positive eletrode should be connected to the bottom buffer reservior). **Apply a voltage of 8V/cm to the gel**. After the dye front has moved into the resolving gel, increase **the voltage to 15V/cm** and run the gel untill the bromophenol blue reaches the bottom of the resolving gel. Minigels (~8cm in length) are usually completed within an hour; larger gels will require longer electrophoresis  time.
5. Remove the gel sandwich from the apparatus and place on a paper towel. Use an extra gel spacer or wedge to carefully pry the plates apart. If samples are loaded in a symmetric manner, the orientation of the gel can be marked by clipping a corner from the bottom of the gel that is closest to the leftmost well.

## Trouble shooting 

Polyacrylamide Gel electrophoresis is well-established technique. Nonetheless, issues can still arise that require special attention or further optimization. For technical issues with electrophoresis equipment, sonsult the manufacturer’s manual.

> Problem : Protein does not migrate at the expected position relative to molecular weight standard.

- Relatively high hydrophobicity, highly charged sequences, and certain posttranslational modifications such as glycosylaytion or phosphorylation influence protein mobility on SDS-PAGE gels (Weber et al. 1972). Thusm apparent molecular weight can differ from the true mass of thje polypeptide chain; the anomalous migration will be consistently observed.
- In addition to degradation, unintended splicing or teanslational errors can result in truncated proteins. Reexamine the DNA sequence for rare codons, internal start or stop codons, or other mutation that could result in incomplete translation.

> Problem : Protein bands do not stain well, become diffuse, or disappear after staining

- This is most common with smaller proteins (<12kDa) that can diffuse from gel during staining and destaining. Using a faster staining protocol (See protocol 8 and the alternative protocols) and minimizing delay between steps may improve the appearance of these bands.
- Very small proteins (<4kDa) may require a fixing reagent that covalently cross-links protein such as formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde. Before staining, incubate the gel in the fixing solution used for silver staining (see the Alternative Protocol Staining SDS-Polyacrylamide gells with Silver Salts) for at least 1h or overnight at room temperature with gentle shacking. Wash with deionized H2O three times for 30 sec each, then proceed with Coomassie staining as described in Protocol 8. Of course, recovery of fixed proteins from gels will be drastically reduced.
- Gels that have been destained too long may simply be restained
- Not enough protein was loaded onto the gel Coomassie stain will detect a minimum of 0.1ug in each protein band (refer to Protocol 10). If Coomassie blue is not sensitive enough, the gel can be rinsed and restained with silver salts (see the Alternative Protocol Staining SDS-Polyacrylamind Gels with Sliver salts).

> Problem : the dye Front and bands curve up (“smiling”) or down(“frowing”) at the edges on the gel

- “Smiling” may result from uneven temperature across the width of the gel, with the spacers acting as heat sinks near it’s edges. This mat be remedied by using active temperature control (I.e., placing the apparatus at 4C), adding more buffer to the outer reserviore to help dissipate heat, and/or reducing the power. Overheating can distort bands or even cause the plates to fracture.
- “Frowning” can be caused by an uneven field due to electrical discontinuities such as air bubbles trapped at the bottom of the plates, or uneven gel thickness. Incomplete polmerization at the edges of the gel may also contribute to “frowning”. Be sure that no air is trapped in the gel or under the gel sandwich and that the gel has polymerized completely before starting.

> Problem : There is inadequate resolution of the protein bands.

- Optimization of acrylamide monomer concentration, bis-acrlyamide concentration, or running time may be required. In general, resolution of smaller proteins is favored with higher-percentage gels and more extensive cross-linking, and vice versa for larger proteins. Increasing the amount of bis-acrylamide cross-linker decrease the matrix pore size and will influence the guidelines for separation of larger proteins. The use of a prestained molecular weight standard can help to visualize band separation during the run
- In some cases, resolution of closely spaced bands can be improved by loading less sample or a lower concentration of protein so that  bands are thinner.

> Problem : There are diffuse, streaky, ot smeared bands.

- It is essential that gel buffers be prepared from Tris base. If Tris-Cl is used, the ionic strength will be too high, resulting in stacking failure and extremely diffuse bands.
- High concentrations of salt in a sample can result in band distortion. Reduction the salt concentration of the sample by dialysis, precipitation, or desalting.
- The voltage may be too high. Electrophorese at 8V/cm until the dye front has passed through the stacking gel, then increase to 10-15V/cm.
- Aggregated material will accumulate in the well and slowly dissolve during electrophoresis, creating a streak. Hydrophobic proteins such those containing multiple transmembrane domains may aggregate or multimerize when boiled. To aviod this, denature these samples for 10-60 min at  45C-55C. for other insoluble proteins (such as the pellet from Protocol 4, Step 9), add 4-8M urea or increase the concentration of SDS to solubilize the protein.

> Problem : There is a metallic sheen on the gel after Coomassie staining

- The solvent was allowed to evaporate. causing the dye to dry on the gel or precipitate out of solution. Rinse the gel for 15 sec in methanol and immediately return to water or Destain solution.

> Problem : There is high backgound in silver stain.

- Only high-purity water and clean dishes shoud be used. Glassware used for silver staining dmay be very effectively cleaned with 1% nitiric acid.


## Discussion 

Most applications suse a discontinuous polyacrylamide gel and buffer system first used by Ornstrin(1964) and Davis (1964) and modified by Laemmli (1970) to contain 0.1% SDS in all components of the system. **The system is discontinuous** with **respect to the percent polyacrylamide** used in **the staking and resolving gels** and with **respect to the pH and ionic composition of the buffer components.** The sample and the stacking gel both contain **Tris-Cl (pH 6.8)**, the resolving gel contains **Tris-Cl (pH 8.8)**, and the upper and lower **buffer reseroires contain Tris-Cl (pH 8.3)**. At pH 6.8, migrates much slower than than chloride ions. Thus, when voltage is applied, chloride ions in the sample and stacking gel begin to migrate away from glycine and form the leading edge of a moving boundary, whereas glycine molecules comprise the trailing edge. between these boundaries, a zone of low conductivity and steep voltage gradient develops, which pulls the glycine along. SDS-coated polypeptides are intermediate in their mobilities and become concentratted (“stacked”) between the two successive fronts. At the interface to the resolving gel , the pH chages abruptly to 8.8, which favors the ionization of glycine. The glycine ions accelerate past the polypeptides and stack them even further. This stacking effect compresses the polypeptides inth thin, sharpzones before separation and greatly increases the resolution of the samples. Glycine ions continue to travel through the resolving gel immediately behind the chloride ions. Once freed from the moving boundary, the SDS-polypeptide complexs move though the resolving gel in a zone of uniform voltage and pH and are separated according to size by the sieving action of the polyacrylamide matrix.

The porosity of the polyacrylamide matrix determines the range of molecular weight that can be resolved effectively. Polyacrylamide gels are composed of linear chains of polymeried acrylamide cross-linked by a bifunctional agent N,N’-methlene-bis-acrylamide(Fig. 1). Porosity depends on the concentration of acrylamide used to prepare the gel and on the degree of cross-linking; that is, the size of these pores decreases as the acrylamide and bis-acrylamide concentrations increase. Cross-links also add rigidity and tensile strength to the gel. Most SDS-polyacrylamide gels are cast with a molar ratio of bis-acrylamide:acrylamide of 1:29, which can resolve polypeptides differing in size by as little as 3%. Table 1 shows the effective separation range for gels made with polyacrylamide concentrations, including gradient gels, are offered by many vendors (Bio-rad, Life Technologies, GenScript, and others). Note that precast gels are often preapred without SDS and canve used for either SDS-PAGE or native PAGE with nondenaturing detergent systems (Ramheesigh et al. 1999).

Proteins separated by PAGE are typically detected by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or with Silver salts. Coomassie Brilliant Blue permeates the gel and bind non specifically and relatively rapidly to proteins, thereby allowing their visualization as discrete blue bands within the translucent polymer matrix (Wilson 1983).Silver staining of protein is based on the differential reduction of silver ions in a reaction similar to that used in photographic process. Silver staining, although somwhat more laborious, is significantly more sensitive because it allows detection dof proteins at concentrations nearly 100-fold lower than Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Switzer rt al. 1979; Merril et al. 1984)
