DoE allows use of a minimum number of experiments, in which several experimental parameters can be varied simultaneously. Based on the obtained data, a mathematical model of the sudied process (e.g., a protein purification protocol or a chromatography step) is created. The model can be used to umderstand the influence of the experimental parameters on the outcome and to find an optimum for the process.
