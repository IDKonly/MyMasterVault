TERRA transcriptionda telomeric repeat-containing family of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) transcribed into telomeric tracts from promoters embedded in subtelomeres 
[[Subtelomeric Transcription and its Regulation]]

: In biology, TERRA (telomeric repeat containing RNA) refers to a type of non-coding RNA that is transcribed from the telomeric regions of chromosomes. Telomeres are the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes that help to preserve the integrity of the genome. TERRA molecules are thought to play a role in the maintenance of telomeres and in the regulation of gene expression.

TERRA molecules are transcribed from the DNA template by an enzyme called telomerase, which is present in many types of cells. These molecules are then processed and modified by various cellular pathways, and they can interact with a number of different proteins and other molecules in the cell. TERRA molecules have been shown to have a variety of functions, including modulating the activity of telomerase, regulating the stability and expression of telomere-associated proteins, and influencing the structure of telomeres.

In recent years, the study of TERRA has gained increasing attention due to the potential role that these molecules may play in the biology of aging and in the development of diseases such as cancer. Further research is needed to fully understand the functions of TERRA and how they may be involved in various biological processes.
