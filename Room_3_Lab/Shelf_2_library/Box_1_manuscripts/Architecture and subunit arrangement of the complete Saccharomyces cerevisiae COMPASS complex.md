Abstract
---
Methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) is catalyzed by the multi-component COMPASS or COMPASS-like complex, which is highly conserved from yeast to human, and plays essential roles in gene expression and transcription, cell cycle progression, and DNA repair. Here we present a cryo-EM map of the complete S. cerevisiae COMPASS complex. Through tag or Fab labeling strategy combined with cryo-EM 3D reconstruction and cross-linking and mass spectrometry (XL-MS) analysis, we uncovered new information on the subunit arrangement: Cps50, Cps35, and Cps30 were determined to group together to form the face region in the head of the complex, and Cps40 and the N-terminal portion of Set1 reside on the top of the head. Our map reveals the location of the active center and a canyon in the back of the head. Together, our study provides the first snapshot of the complete architecture of yeast COMPASS and a picture of its subunit interaction network, which could facilitate our understanding of the COMPASS machinery and its functionality.
