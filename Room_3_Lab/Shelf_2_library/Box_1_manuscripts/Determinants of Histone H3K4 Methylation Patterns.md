Abstract
---
Various factors differentially recognize trimethylated histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) near promoters, H3K4me2 just downstream, and promoter-distal H3K4me1 to modulate gene expression. This methylation "gradient" is thought to result from preferential binding of the H3K4 methyltransferase Set1/complex â€¦
