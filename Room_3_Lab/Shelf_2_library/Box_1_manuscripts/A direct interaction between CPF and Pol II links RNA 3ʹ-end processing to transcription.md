Abstract
---
Transcription termination by RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) is linked to RNA 3สน-end processing by the [[cleavage and polyadenylation factor]] (CPF). CPF contains endonuclease, poly(A) polymerase and protein phosphatase activities that cleave and polyadenylate the pre-mRNA, and dephosphorylate Pol II to control transcription. Exactly how the RNA 3สน-end processing machinery is coupled to transcription remains unclear. Here, we combine in vitro reconstitution, electron cryo-microscopy and X-ray crystallography to show that CPF physically and functionally interacts with Pol II. Surprisingly, [[Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factor|CPF]]-mediated dephosphorylation promotes the formation of a Pol II stalk-to-stalk homodimer. This dimer is compatible with transcription (unlike other Pol II dimers) but not with the binding of transcription elongation factors. We show that the [[Ref2]] subunit of CPF contributes directly to the interaction with Pol II and also regulates the [[Glc7]]/PP1 [[Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factor|CPF]] phosphatase. We hypothesize that Pol II dimerization may play a role in gene looping and may provide a mechanistic basis for the allosteric model of transcription termination.
