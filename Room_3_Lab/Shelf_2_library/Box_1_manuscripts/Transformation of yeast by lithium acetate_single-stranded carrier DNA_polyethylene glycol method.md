Abstract
---
In this chapter we have provided instructions for transforming yeast by a number of variations of the LiAc/SS-DNA/PEG method for a number of different applications. The rapid transformation protocol is used when small numbers of transformants are required. The high efficiency transformation protocol is used to generate large numbers of transformants or to deliver DNA constructs or oligonucleotides into the yeast cell. The large-scale transformation protocol is primarily applicable to the analysis of complex plasmid DNA libraries, such as those required for the yeast two-hybrid system. The microtiter plate versions of the rapid and high efficiency transformation protocols can be applied to high-throughput screening technologies.
