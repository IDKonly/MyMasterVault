Abstract
---
The 3'-ends of eukaryotic pre-mRNAs are processed in the nucleus by a large multiprotein complex, the [[cleavage and polyadenylation factor]] ([[Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factor|CPF]]). [[Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factor|CPF]] cleaves RNA, adds a poly(A) tail and signals transcription termination. [[Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factor|CPF]] harbors four enzymatic activities essential for these processes, but how these are coordinated remains poorly understood. Several subunits of [[Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factor|CPF]], including two protein phosphatases, are also found in the related 'associated with Pta1' (APT) complex, but the relationship between [[Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factor|CPF]] and APT is unclear. Here, we show that the APT complex is physically distinct from [[Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factor|CPF]]. The 21 kDa Syc1 protein is associated only with APT, and not with [[Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factor|CPF]], and is therefore the defining subunit of APT. Using ChIP-seq, PAR-CLIP and RNA-seq, we show that Syc1/APT has distinct, but possibly overlapping, functions from those of [[Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factor|CPF]]. Syc1/APT plays a more important role in sn/snoRNA production whereas [[Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factor|CPF]] processes the 3'-ends of protein-coding pre-mRNAs. These results define distinct protein machineries for synthesis of mature eukaryotic protein-coding and non-coding RNAs.
