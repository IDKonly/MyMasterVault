> The human genome encodes thousands of non-coding RNAs. Many of these terminate early and are then rapidly degraded, but how their transcription is restricted is poorly understood. In a screen for protein-coding gene transcriptional termination factors, we identified ZC3H4. Its depletion causes upregulation and extension of hundreds of unstable transcripts, particularly antisense RNAs and those transcribed from so-called super-enhancers. These loci are occupied by ZC3H4, suggesting that it directly functions in their transcription. Consistently, engineered tethering of ZC3H4 to reporter RNA promotes its degradation by the exosome. ZC3H4 is predominantly metazoan –interesting when considering its impact on enhancer RNAs that are less prominent in single-celled organisms. Finally, ZC3H4 loss causes a substantial reduction in cell proliferation, highlighting its overall importance. In summary, we identify ZC3H4 as playing an important role in restricting non-coding transcription in multicellular organisms.

> ZC3H4 has been proposed as an equivalent to Drosophila Suppressor of Sable (Su(s)), which negatively regulates transcription via promoter-proximal termination (Brewer-Jensen et al., 2016; Kuan et al., 2004). ZC3H4 and Su(s) share little sequence homology, but they have similar structural makeup with zinc fingers flanked by largely disordered regions. Su(s) depletion stabilises selected RNAs and causes their aberrant elongation and stability, mirroring what we see globally following ZC3H4 depletion. There is no known catalytic activity for ZC3H4 or Su(s), but they are related to CPSF30 which shows endonuclease activity in Drosophila and Arabidopsis (Addepalli and Hunt, 2007; Bai and Tolias, 1996). It remains to be seen whether ZC3H4 possesses any catalytic activity or mediates its effects through interaction partners. Interestingly, IP and mass spectrometry indicate that WDR82 may be the only interacting partner of Su(s) (Brewer-Jensen et al., 2016). WDR82 has been shown to bind to Pol II phosphorylated on Serine 5 of its C-terminal domain, which may provide a means to recruit ZC3H4 to promoter-proximal regions (Lee and Skalnik, 2008).
