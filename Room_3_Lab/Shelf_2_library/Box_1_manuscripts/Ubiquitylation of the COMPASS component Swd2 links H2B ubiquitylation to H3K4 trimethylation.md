Abstract
---
Mono-ubiquitylation of histone H2B correlates with transcriptional activation and is required for di- and trimethylation at Lys 4 on the histone H3 tail (H3K4) by the [[SET1]]/[[COMPASS]] methyltransferase complex through a poorly characterized trans-tail pathway. Here we show that mono-ubiquitylation of histone H2B promotes ubiquitylation at Lys 68 and Lys 69 of [[Swd2]], the essential component of [[SET1]]/[[COMPASS]] in [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]. We found that Rad6/Bre1 ubiquitylation enzymes responsible for H2B ubiquitylation also participate directly in [[Swd2]] modification. Preventing [[Swd2]] or H2B ubiquitylation did not affect [[Set1]] stability, interaction of [[Swd2]] with [[Set1]] or the ability of [[Swd2]] to interact with chromatin. However, we found that mutation of Lys 68 and Lys 69 of [[Swd2]] markedly reduced trimethylation, and to a lesser extent dimethylation, of H3K4 at the 5'-end of transcribing genes without affecting monomethylation. This effect results from the ability of [[Swd2]] ubiquitylation to control recruitment of Spp1, a [[COMPASS]] subunit necessary for trimethylation. Our results further indicate that [[Swd2]] is a major H3-[[binding]] component of [[COMPASS]]. **[[Swd2]] thus represents a key factor that mediates crosstalk between H2B ubiquitylation and H3K4 trimethylation on chromatin.**


>On the basis of the results presented here, we propose that [[Swd2]] participates in the recruitment of the [[COMPASS]] complex to chromatin through its ability to interact directly with unmodified H3. 

>Transcription and H2B-dependent recruitment of Rad6/Bre1 lead to ubiquitylation of both H2B and [[Swd2]] on Lys 68 and Lys 69, a modification that controls the chromatin recruitment of Spp1, a [[COMPASS]] subunit required for trimethylation of H3K4 (refs 23,24). 

>In turn, trimethylated H3K4 may stabilize the interaction between Spp1 and chromatin because of its preferential [[binding]] to di- and trimethylated H3K4 (ref. 25). This would allow the efficient recruitment of a complete and stable [[COMPASS]] complex on methylated H3K4 to fulfill trimethylation (Fig. 4d). 

>Such a succession of events would correspond to an essential step in the crosstalk between H2B ubiquitylation and H3K4 trimethylation.
