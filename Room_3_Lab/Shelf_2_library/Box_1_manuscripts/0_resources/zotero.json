Despite this primordial role of chromatin, little is known about chromatin organization, and in particular about nucleosome positioning on unmodified subtelomere–telomere junctions in\n                Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\n              \n            \n            \n              Results\n              By ChEC experiments and indirect end-labeling, we characterized nucleosome positioning as well as specialized protein–DNA associations on most subtelomere–telomere junctions present in budding yeast. The results show that there is a relatively large nucleosome-free region at chromosome ends. Despite the absence of sequence homologies between the two major classes of subtelomere–telomere junctions (i.e.: Y’-telomeres and X-telomeres), all analyzed subtelomere–telomere junctions show a terminal nucleosome-free region just distally from the known Rap1-covered telomeric repeats. Moreover, previous evidence suggested a telomeric chromatin fold-back structure onto subtelomeric areas that supposedly was implicated in chromosome end protection. The in vivo ChEC method used herein in conjunction with several proteins in a natural context revealed no evidence for such structures in bulk chromatin.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Our study allows a structural definition of the chromatin found at chromosome ends in budding yeast. This definition, derived with direct in vivo approaches, includes a terminal area that is free of nucleosomes, certain positioned nucleosomes and conserved DNA-bound protein complexes. This organization of subtelomeric and telomeric areas however does not include a telomeric cis-loopback conformation. We propose that the observations on such fold-back structures may report rare and/or transient associations and not stable or constitutive structures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Pasquier","given":"Emeline"},{"family":"Wellinger","given":"Raymund J."}],"citation-key":"pasquier_vivo_2020","container-title":"Epigenetics & Chromatin","container-title-short":"Epigenetics & Chromatin","DOI":"10.1186/s13072-020-00344-w","ISSN":"1756-8935","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,12]]},"language":"en","page":"23","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"In vivo chromatin organization on native yeast telomeric regions is independent of a cis-telomere loopback conformation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://epigeneticsandchromatin.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13072-020-00344-w","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"swygert_sir_2018","abstract":"Significance\n            Eukaryotic chromosomes are organized into specialized, nucleoprotein domains that can regulate nuclear functions. Heterochromatin is a silenced chromatin region essential for maintaining genomic stability and driving developmental processes. Cell biological studies have indicated that heterochromatin is highly condensed, though the complicated structure and dynamics of heterochromatin have rendered it difficult to characterize. Here we reconstitute heterochromatin fibers with purified components and exploit a powerful combination of sedimentation velocity, molecular modeling, and atomic force microscopy to characterize the stoichiometry and condensed conformation of heterochromatin fibers.\n          , \n            Heterochromatin is a silenced chromatin region essential for maintaining genomic stability and driving developmental processes. The complicated structure and dynamics of heterochromatin have rendered it difficult to characterize. In budding yeast, heterochromatin assembly requires the SIR proteins—Sir3, believed to be the primary structural component of SIR heterochromatin, and the Sir2–4 complex, responsible for the targeted recruitment of SIR proteins and the deacetylation of lysine 16 of histone H4. Previously, we found that Sir3 binds but does not compact nucleosomal arrays. Here we reconstitute chromatin fibers with the complete complement of SIR proteins and use sedimentation velocity, molecular modeling, and atomic force microscopy to characterize the stoichiometry and conformation of SIR chromatin fibers. In contrast to fibers with Sir3 alone, our results demonstrate that SIR arrays are highly compact. Strikingly, the condensed structure of SIR heterochromatin fibers requires both the integrity of H4K16 and an interaction between Sir3 and Sir4. We propose a model in which a dimer of Sir3 bridges and stabilizes two adjacent nucleosomes, while a Sir2–4 heterotetramer interacts with Sir3 associated with a nucleosomal trimer, driving fiber compaction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Swygert","given":"Sarah G."},{"family":"Senapati","given":"Subhadip"},{"family":"Bolukbasi","given":"Mehmet F."},{"family":"Wolfe","given":"Scot A."},{"family":"Lindsay","given":"Stuart"},{"family":"Peterson","given":"Craig L."}],"citation-key":"swygert_sir_2018","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","container-title-short":"Proc.

We tested whether this requirement could be bypassed at the HM loci and telomeres in cells containing a stably expressed, but catalytically inactive mutant of Sir2p, sir2-345p, plus histone mutants that mimic the hypoacetylated state normally created by Sir2p. Sir protein spreading was rescued in sir2-345 mutants expressing histones in which key lysine residues in their N-termini had been mutated to arginine. Mating in these mutants was also partially restored upon overexpression of Sir3p. Together, these results indicate that histone hypoacetylation is sufficient for Sir protein spreading in the absence of production of 2′-O-acetyl-ADP ribose by sir2p and Sir2p's enzymatic function for silencing can be bypassed in a subset of cells in a given population. These results also provide genetic evidence for the existence of additional critical substrates of Sir2p for silencing in vivo.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Yang","given":"Bo"},{"family":"Kirchmaier","given":"Ann L."}],"citation-key":"yang_bypassing_2006","container-title":"Molecular Biology of the Cell","container-title-short":"MBoC","DOI":"10.1091/mbc.e06-08-0669","editor":[{"family":"Bloom","given":"Kerry"}],"ISSN":"1059-1524, 1939-4586","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2006,12]]},"language":"en","page":"5287-5297","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Bypassing the Catalytic Activity of SIR2 for SIR Protein Spreading in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/10.1091/mbc.e06-08-0669","volume":"17"},
