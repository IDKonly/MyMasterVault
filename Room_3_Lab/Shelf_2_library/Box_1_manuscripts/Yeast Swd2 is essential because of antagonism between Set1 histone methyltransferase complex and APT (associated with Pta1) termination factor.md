Abstract
---
The [[Set1]] complex (also known as complex associated with [[Set1]] or [[COMPASS]]) methylates histone H3 on lysine 4, with different levels of methylation affecting transcription by recruiting various factors to distinct regions of active genes. Neither [[Set1]] nor its associated proteins are essential for viability with the notable exception of [[Swd2]], a WD repeat protein that is also a subunit of the essential transcription termination factor APT (associated with Pta1). Cells lacking [[Set1]] lose [[COMPASS]] recruitment but show increased promoter cross-linking of TFIIE large subunit and the serine 5 phosphorylated form of the Rpb1 [[C-terminal domain]]. Although [[Swd2]] is normally required for bringing APT to genes, deletion of [[SET1]] restores both viability and APT recruitment to a strain lacking [[Swd2]]. We propose a model in which [[Swd2]] is required for APT to overcome antagonism by [[COMPASS]].

# 요약

**Background**: The essential protein [[Swd2]] is in both H3K4 methyltransferase complex [[COMPASS|Set1C]]/[[COMPASS]] and transcription termination factor APT. 

**Results**: [[Set1]] deletion increases promoter cross-linking of the TFIIE large subunit and phosphorylated [[C-terminal domain|CTD]], decreases [[COMPASS]] and [[Swd2]], and suppresses lethality of [[Swd2]] depletion. 

**Conclusion**: [[Set1]]-[[COMPASS]] affects early transcription and creates a requirement for [[Swd2]] in APT recruitment. 

**Significance**: [[Swd2]] may coordinate H3K4 methylation and early transcription termination.
