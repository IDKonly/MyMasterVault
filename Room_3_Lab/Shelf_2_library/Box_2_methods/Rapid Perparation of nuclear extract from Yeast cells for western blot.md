# method

## Overnight cell culture 
1. Inoculate 5ml YPD appropriate selection media with small amount of cells from plate.
2. Allow to grow overnight with rotating at 30C

## Harvest and wash 
1. Harvest cells by centrifugation at 3000rpm for 5min
2. Pour off media and wash with 1ml H<sub>2</sub>O
	1. resuspend the pellet with water and harvest by centrifuge at 3000rpm for 5min

## Nuclear extraction 
1. resuspend in 200ul NIB (nuclear isolating buffer, 4ºC에 있음) 
2. prepare 1.5ml with 100ul(under) glass beads (0.5mm) and transfer NIB mixture to 1.5ml tube.
3. Vortex in cold room(4ºC) for 20~30min
	1. Vortex와 동시에 heat block 켜놓기
4. Poke hole in bottom of tube with a needle and allow liquid to flow into original 1.5ml tube by centrifugation at 3000rpm for 5min.
	1. 충분히! 잘! 뚫는다
5. Pipette off supernatant 
6. Add 2 pellet-volume of water (around 100ul) and transfer to 1.5ml tube.
7. Add same volume of [[Solutions#4X loading dye|4X loading dye]] and boil(95ºC heatblock) for 5min.
