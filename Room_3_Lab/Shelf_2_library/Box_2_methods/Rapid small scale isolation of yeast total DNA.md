# Method
## Cell culture and Harvest
1. [[Yeast Cell culture#Overnight cell culture|Yeast cell culture during overnight]] (in 5ml broth at 30’C)
	1. Early stationaty phase : > 2 * 10^8 cells/ml
2. [[Cell harvest]] and wash diH2O → Transfer to 1.5ml tube; Harvest cell in 1.5ml tube.

## protoplasting
1. Suspend with [[Solutions#Protoplasting buffer|Protoplasting buffer]] 
	1. 200ul TE 200ul, $\beta$-mercaptoethanol 2ul, zymolase(100mg/ml) 0.2ul 
		1. **매번 만들어서 쓴다.**
		2. 요는 잘 섞는 것
	2. incubate in 37C(or Room temperature), least 12min, inverse occaisionally
2. Add 200ul of [[Solutions#Lysis solution|lysis solution]].
	1. **준비되어 있다.**

## DNA purification
1. Incubate at 65C for 20min
	1. Heat block
2. Rapidly cool on ice (and incubate ~8min)
	1. 확실하게 식힌다.
3. Add 200ul 5M potassium acetate (=POAc, pH5.4) 
	1. inverse and incubate 15min on ice.
4. Centrifuge at **12000rpm 4C** during 15min.
	1. Transfer sup. to fresh tube.
5. Add 360ul volume of isopropanol(=IPA).
	1. Inverse
	2. Incubate at RT during 5min
6. centrifuge at **12000rpm during 15min** → remove sup.
7. Add 200ul of 70% ethanol.
	1. incubate at RT during 5min.
8. centrifuge at **12000rpm during 30sec.**
9. Dry pellet → add diH2O
