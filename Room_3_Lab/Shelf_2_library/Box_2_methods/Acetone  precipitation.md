## Materials required

- Cold (-20째C ) acetone, a volume of four times that of the samples to be precipitated
- Centrifuge tube, made of acetone-compatible polypropylene and able to hold five times the Sample volume
- Centrifuge and rotor the tube used, minimum 13,000g x g required
## Protocol

1. Cool the required volume of acetone to -20째C 
2. Place protein sample in acetone-compatible tube.
3. Add four times the sample volume of cold (-20째C) acetone to the tube.
4. Vortex tube and incubate for 60 minute at -20째C.
5. Centrifuge 10 minutes at 12000rpm 
6. Decant and properly dispose of the supernatant, being careful to not dislodge the protein pellet.
	1. *Optional :* If additional cycles of precipitation are necessary to complemently remove thje interfering substance, then repeat steps 2-5 before proceeding to step 7.
7. Allow the acetone to evaporate from the uncapped tube at room temperature for 30 minutes. Do not over-dry pellet, or it may not dissolve property.
8. Add buffer appropriate for the downstream process and vortex thoroughly to dissolve pretein pellet.
