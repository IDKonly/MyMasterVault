## SDS-PAGE

1. SDS-PAGE : Load 1ul of **1/10 diluted protein marker** in the first lane
2. Working in clean Electrophoresis buffer, PAGE tank.
3. Before Staining, Clean up Bowls with 3DW.
## Fixation
1. Soak the gel in **fixative solution 50ml** for 1hr, shaking
2. Soak the gel in **20% ethanol** during 20mins, shaking
## Pre-treat
1. **Pretreat solution 50ml** for 2minutes, shaking
2. Wash with **DW 50ml**, 20sec, shaking(x3)

## Staining
1. Soak in **Silver staining solution 50ml** for 1hour, shaking
2. Wash with **DW 50ml**, 30sec, shaking(x3)
	1. Do not longer. If you does longer this step, Silver ion in acrylamide gel will be cleaned out.
## Develop
1. **Develop solution 50ml**, shaking 보일때까지
## Destaining
9. **Destaining solution**, shaking
