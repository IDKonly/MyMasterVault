>it is advisable to check, by detecting the ProtA moiety of the TAP tag by Western blot, whether extraction is efficient and if the TAP tag is not degraded under these specific conditions.

>we recommend the following standard procedure that has been extensively used in our laboratory.

#### Extract preparation

> Extracts are routinely prepared from 2 liters of yeast cells grown to late log phase (OD600 ,2–3).

> Cell pellets are washed once with water and pelleted again in a 50-ml polypropylene tube (Falcon).

>The packed cell volume (PCV) is measured and the tube is frozen with liquid nitrogen.

>Frozen cell pellets may be stored at -80℃.

> One PCV of buffer A is added to the pellet, which is repidlt thawed and kept at 4℃.

> All subsequent steps are performed at 4℃ with precooled buffer and equipment.

> Cells are broken by passing them three times through a French press (Sim-Amino) at a pressure of  … (Cell lysis)

> The extract is centrifuged at 25,000g for 30 min and the supernatant is transferred into a new tube.

> The extract is then centrifuged at 100,000g for 1h.

> After this centrifugation step three phases are visible and in the tube: a lipidic phase floating on top, a pellet of cellular debris on the bottom, and a middle phase containing the extract. This last phase is recoverd and dialyzed against buffer D for 3h at 4℃.

> After dialysis, the extract is frozen and kept at -80℃.

#### TAP purification

> We perform all the binding and elution steps in 0.8 X 4 cm poly-prep columns (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA)

> One hundred microliters of IgG sepharose beads (Pharmacia Piscatawat, NJ), corresponding to 200ul of bead suspension, is transferred into the column.

> The beads are washed with 10ml IPP150(calmodulin binding buffer).

> The composition of the extract buffer is adjusted to …(recipe)

> Then the extract is transferred into the column containing the washed beads and rotated for 2h at 4℃.

> Elution is done by gravity flow and the beads are washed thress times with 10ml of IPP150 and once with 10ml of TEV cleavage buffer (IPP180 adjusted to 0.5 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT). Cleavage is done in the same column by adding 1ml of TEV cleavage buffer and 100 units of TEV protease (Gibco Ronkonkona, NY).

> The beads are rorated for 2h at 16℃ and the eluted is recoverd by gravity flow.

> One hundred microliters of calmdulin beads (Straragene, La Jolla, CA), corresponding to 200ul of vead suspension, is transferred into a column and washed with 10ml of IPP150 calmoduling binding buffer.

> Three milliliters of IPP150 calmodulin binding buffer and 3ul of 1M CaCl<sub>2</sub> are added to the 1ml of elute recovered after TEV cleavage,

> This solution is then transferred to the column containing washed calmodulin beads and rotated for 1h at 4℃.

> After the beads are washed with 30ml of IPP150 calmodulin binding buffer, the bound proteins are eluted with 1ml of IPP150 calmodulin elution buffer(recipe).

> Five elution fractions of 200ul each are collected. The elution peak is usually found in fractions 2 and 3.

> It is noteworthy that the two purification steps of the TAP method can be performed in the reverse order.

purification step을 반대로해도 된다. 즉 calmodulin → IgG 순서로 purification 할 수 있다.

> However, one shoud remember that, in this case, the final purified fraction remains contaminated with TEV protease.

→ 하나 기억해두어야 할 것은 마지막 fraction에는 TEV protease로 오염되어 있을 확률이 높다.


#### Variations in the Purification Protocol

>**Extracts can be also preprared with glass beads and a bead beater.**

> In our hands, any of the methods used for extract preparation can be scaled up without affecting the results.
