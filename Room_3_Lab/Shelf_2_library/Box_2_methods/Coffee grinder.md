> Freeze cell pellets at -80℃. Once the pelltes are frozen, transfer them to a bucket of dry ice while you prepare the grinder. Take 2 or 3 small pieces of dry ice and pulverize them with the grinder to make a fine powder. This will cool the grinder and stop the cells from thawing as quickly. Wrap the 50mL tube in a terri-wipe and crack open the bottom with the sledgehammer. The pellet should separate from the tube with adequate persuasion, and don’t worry about getting little pieces of plastic mixed with the cells. Add the frozen pellet to the grinder and pulverize to a fine powder. If necessary, add more dry ice to stop cells from thawing. Empty the powder into a fresh 50mL tube and add a volume of binding buffer equivalent to the volume of the frozen pellet.
